# 2nd lesson: Accessing a shared variable from multiple tasks(threads)

Lesson: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95yUbClyf3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95yUbClyf3E)

In the lesson, the task was creating two tasks, one that would blink an LED, and the other would listen to the Serial port and read the input from the user as the new blinking delay. By default, the I set the delay to *500ms* then I change it as I wish using the Serial monitor (or any serial interface, such as Putty).

As a bonus, I added a Green LED that woudl flash for *200ms* each time a change is made.
